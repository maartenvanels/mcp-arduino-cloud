# Arduino Cloud Home Automation Context

This file can be used to provide context to Claude about your specific Arduino Cloud setup.
Copy this to CLAUDE.md and customize it with your device information.

## Quick Commands Examples
- "Turn on the office light" → uses `control_light` with lightName="office" action="on"
- "Dim the kitchen lights to 50%" → uses `control_light` with lightName="kitchen" action="dim" brightness=50
- "Turn off all lights" → uses `control_light` multiple times for different rooms

## Example Device Structure

### Living Room
- **Thing**: MainController (ID: your-thing-id-here)
- **Lights**: 
  - Living_Room_Main (dimmable)
  - Living_Room_Accent (dimmable)

### Kitchen
- **Thing**: KitchenController (ID: your-thing-id-here)
- **Lights**:
  - Kitchen_Counter (dimmable)
  - Kitchen_Island (dimmable)
  - Kitchen_Cabinet (on/off)

### Sensors
- Temperature_Living (HOME_TEMPERATURE_C)
- Motion_Kitchen (HOME_MOTION_SENSOR)

## Tips for Quick Control
1. Use the `control_light` tool - it automatically searches for lights
2. You can use partial names: "office", "kitchen", "bedroom"
3. For dimmable lights: specify brightness (0-100)
4. Non-dimmable lights only accept on/off commands
